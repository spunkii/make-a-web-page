<p>"Cascading" means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' child elements. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect.

    You first write a selector. If you want to style all paragraphs of a page you use p then { } if you only want to say that a class has a style then you use the attribute of the style, like description.
